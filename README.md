# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
Step 1:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points.

Step 2:
Assign the values of point 1 and point 2 whose distance is to be calculated.

Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula formula. Substitute the values in the distance formula formula

Step 4:
Print the coding to get the answer.

Step 5:
Execute the program.
